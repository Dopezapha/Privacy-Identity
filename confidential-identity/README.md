# Privacy-Preserving Identity Smart Contract

A secure and privacy-focused smart contract built on Stacks blockchain for managing digital identities, credentials, and selective disclosure of personal information.

## About

This smart contract implements a privacy-preserving identity management system that enables users to:
- Register and manage their digital identities
- Issue and manage verifiable credentials
- Control selective disclosure of personal information
- Verify credentials while maintaining privacy

## Features

### Core Functionality
- Secure identity registration with public key infrastructure
- Credential management system
- Selective disclosure mechanism
- ‚è±Time-bound credential validity
- Credential revocation capability
- Identity update functionality

### Privacy Features
- Zero-knowledge proof support for verification
- Selective attribute disclosure
- Privacy-preserving credential validation
- Encrypted credential storage

## Prerequisites

- Clarity CLI version 2.0 or higher
- Stacks blockchain node
- Node.js v14+ (for testing)


## Contract Structure

### Data Maps
- `user-identities`: Stores user identity information
- `credential-details`: Manages credential metadata
- `disclosure-requests`: Handles selective disclosure requests

### Main Functions

#### Identity Management
```clarity
(define-public (register-user-identity (user-public-key (buff 33)) (user-identity-hash (buff 32))))
(define-public (update-user-identity (updated-identity-hash (buff 32)) (updated-public-key (buff 33))))
```

#### Credential Management
```clarity
(define-public (add-user-credential (credential-hash (buff 32)) (expiration-timestamp uint)))
(define-public (revoke-user-credential (credential-hash (buff 32))))
```

#### Disclosure Control
```clarity
(define-public (initiate-disclosure-request (request-identifier (buff 32))))
(define-public (approve-disclosure (request-identifier (buff 32)) (verification-proof (buff 32))))
```

## Usage Guide

### 1. Identity Registration
```clarity
;; Register a new identity
(contract-call? .privacy-identity-manager register-user-identity 
    0x023a... ;; public key
    0x4569... ;; identity hash
)
```

### 2. Adding Credentials
```clarity
;; Add a new credential
(contract-call? .privacy-identity-manager add-user-credential
    0x7890... ;; credential hash
    u1735689600 ;; expiration timestamp
    "educational" ;; credential category
)
```

### 3. Managing Disclosures
```clarity
;; Create disclosure request
(contract-call? .privacy-identity-manager initiate-disclosure-request
    0x1234... ;; request ID
    (list "name" "age") ;; requested attributes
)
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**
   - All sensitive functions require proper authorization
   - Credential operations limited to authorized issuers
   - Revocation capabilities restricted to credential owners

2. **Privacy Protection**
   - Minimal on-chain data storage
   - Hash-based credential verification
   - Selective disclosure mechanisms

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Immutable credential history
   - Cryptographic proof verification
   - Timestamp-based validity checks

## Error Codes

| Code | Description | Solution |
|------|-------------|----------|
| u100 | ERROR-UNAUTHORIZED-ACCESS | Ensure proper authorization |
| u101 | ERROR-IDENTITY-EXISTS | Use update function instead |
| u102 | ERROR-IDENTITY-NOT-FOUND | Register identity first |
| u103 | ERROR-INVALID-VERIFICATION-PROOF | Check proof generation |
| u104 | ERROR-CREDENTIAL-EXPIRED | Renew or reissue credential |
